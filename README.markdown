Description
----------------------

A collection of demo applications for Chipmunk physics 
engine : http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/
Mainly, it's a Ruby port of demo apps included in the library's distribution,
using Chipmunk-FFI for binding and Ruby-Processing for visualization.


Install
-------

You will need:

* Ruby 1.8.6+ or JRuby 1.5+ ( yep, use unstable )
* Chipmunk > 5.0 (svn right now... http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/ )
* FFI >= 0.6.0 (git right now... http://github.com/ffi/ffi/ )
* Nice-FFI >= 0.3 ( http://github.com/jacius/nice-ffi/ )
* Chipmunk-FFI > 1.0.0 ( http://github.com/shawn42/chipmunk-ffi/ )

OK, no gem yet, gonna fix that as soon as there's more stuff to 
be packed. And yes, most surely, you'll have to do some fixing 
to make it work altogether. If that proves tricky, use lib/ruby-processing-1.0.8.gem, 
it contains everything listed above except Chipmunk itself.
